    	<h1>Hipsters</h1>
   			<p class="harsh">By Harsh Patel</p>

   		<h2>Overview</h2>
   			<p>Hipster refers to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture"/>subculture </a>of young, urban middle-class adults and older teenagers that appeared in the 1990s. The subculture is associated with independent music, a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility, progressive or independent political views, alternative spirituality or atheism/agnosticism, and alternative lifestyles. Interests in media include independent film, magazines such as Clash, and websites like Pitchfork Media.</p>

   		<h2>What the Heck is a Hipster</h2>
   			<p>Hipster culture has been described as a “mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and behavior[s].”[3] Christian Lorentzen of Time Out New York argues that “hipsterism fetishizes the authentic” elements of all of the “fringe movements of the postwar era—beat, hippie, punk, even grunge,” and draws on the “cultural stores of every unmelted ethnicity,” and “regurgitates it with a winking inauthenticity.”</p>
